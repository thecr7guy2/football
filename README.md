## Overview

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover a wide range of football-related topics. These notebooks are designed to help you explore and understand different aspects of football through data visualization and analysis. Whether you're a football enthusiast, a data scientist, or simply curious about the beautiful game, you'll find valuable insights and visualizations here.

## Notebooks
Here's a list of some of the notebooks you'll find in this repository, along with brief descriptions of what each of them focuses on:

- `Waffle_plot.ipynb`: The analysis explores the specifics of how tthe most prolific goal scorers in 2019 scored their goals.
- `Dotmatrix_plot.ipynb`: This visualization showcases the top football players based on the number of passes they made in the 15 seconds leading up to a shot during the World Cup 2018. It provides insights into the playmaking abilities and involvement of these players in critical moments.
- `Mini_Challenge.ipynb`: My first take on Football Data analysis featuring David Sumpter.

## Data
If a notebook uses external data sources, you will find information on how to obtain or link to those data sources within the respective notebook.
